  "description": "This project implements a decentralized computation platform using blockchain technology, where researchers can submit computational jobs, and network participants can contribute unused GPU or CPU power to process these jobs. Our platform uses a Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) consensus mechanism to reward contributors for performing real, valuable computations rather than arbitrary tasks. The result is an efficient, secure, and decentralized system that provides a scalable solution for researchers who need high computational power without relying on centralized cloud services.",
